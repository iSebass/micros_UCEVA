  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the CCP4 driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for CCP4.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.81.8
        Device            :  PIC16F1939
        Driver Version    :  2.02
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 2.36 and above
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X 6.00

    CCP4_Initialize()function should have been called before calling this function.

  @Returns
   true - Indicates compare is complete
   false - Indicates compare is not complete
